# AMD-project

This repository contains the project I made for the Algorithms For Massive Datasets course in the Master of Computer Science at University of Milan. The Google Colab version of the code can be found here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T7iFyK4fXUhtSH5XVz7XVb9TCF_at_Gu?usp=sharing

The task is to implement from scratch a detector of pairs
of similar tweets, considering the text field of the dataset.
